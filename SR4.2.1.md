**Linear Search:**
Works by sequentially checking each element in the list until the desired element is found or the end of the list is reached.
Suitable for small lists or unsorted lists.
Time complexity: O(n) in the worst-case scenario, where n is the number of elements in the list.
**Binary Search:**

Works on sorted lists by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the element is found or the interval is empty.
Requires a sorted list as input.
Time complexity: O(log n) in the worst-case scenario, where n is the number of elements in the list.
**Performance Comparison:**

Binary search is generally faster than linear search for large sorted lists because it reduces the search space exponentially with each comparison.
Linear search performs better for small lists or unsorted lists where the overhead of sorting or maintaining a sorted structure is not justified.
