**Insertion Sort Time Complexity**
The time complexity of the insertion sort algorithm is 
𝑂(𝑛*2)
O(n 2), where 
𝑛
n is the number of elements in the array. This complexity arises from the nested loops used in the insertion sort algorithm. The outer loop iterates through each element in the array, and the inner loop compares the current element with the elements in the sorted portion of the array.

In the worst-case scenario, when the array is in reverse order or nearly sorted in reverse order, each element needs to be moved to its correct position in the sorted portion of the array. This results in approximately 
𝑛

n

 /2 comparisons and swaps.

**Insertion Sort Space Complexity**
The space complexity of the insertion sort algorithm is 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) because it only requires a constant amount of additional space regardless of the input size. The space complexity does not depend on the number of elements being sorted but rather on the algorithm's fixed memory requirements, such as temporary variables used for swapping elements.

**Efficiency in Big-O Notation**
Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
)
O(n 
2
 ) indicates that the time taken by the algorithm grows quadratically with the input size. As the number of elements increases, the time taken to sort the array increases significantly.
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(

)
O(1) signifies that the algorithm's space requirements remain constant irrespective of the input size. This makes insertion sort efficient in terms of memory usage.
